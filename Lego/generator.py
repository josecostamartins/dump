satan = """Satan (who also goes by the aliases Lucifer, The Devil, and Beelzebub
to avoid tax collectors) is the primary antagonist in the best-selling
Christian novel The Bible. His character is usually comically considered the
epitome of evil, and he is often feared, mocked, or just marginalized. In
crafting his image - the horns, hooves, trident used for prodding passerby or
sending his enemies to the depths, and all - the Catholic Church took
inspiration from the Wiccan Horned God and the Greek god Pan, turning loved
archetypes into an evil presence though the wonders of propaganda.<br>
<br>Dispute with god<br>Satan and God had a bit of an argument way back when
over who should call the shots about what happens to the entire universe. Satan
began by laying out his points in a fairly logical fashion, but that's when it
all went to hell (pun intended). This discussion between the two of them was
the catalyst that sparked God's pretend rage, causing some major smiting and
Satan being thrown just outside of the Pearly Gates where he set up his own
kingdom and a lemonade stand.
Although Satan found himself just outside the pearly gates he wasn't about to
take it lying down so he summoned up legions of pretend demons from the pretend
eternal fires to strike back. Meanwhile, back in heaven, God was watching this
unfold. So he asked Michael the Archangel and said, "Mike, take care of it."
Michael got a bunch of angels down to the gates. It wasn't much of a fight,
though, as the angels cast all of the devils out of heaven into the Pit of Hell
in a fashion that would be imitated millions of years later by Leonidas and the
Spartans.<br>
God has laughed about what happened that day ever since, but because Satan and
God are both invincible, the dispute has never ended, except in arm wrestling,
drinking contests, Tic-Tac-Toe, and the occasional wet t-shirt contest.<br>
<br>Satan has inspired genres of music such as death metal and black metal;
among the metal personalities that claim to have business relations with Satan
are bands too nasty to mention. However, in a statement issued as a response to
Christian groups, Satan remarked that "Many of these so-called 'Satanists'
would not realize if they found themselves in Hell." This has been amusing him
since the early-to-mid 20th century, when he invented record companies.
Satan is also affiliated with the rap industry and making deals with Jay-Z and
Beyonce with exposure of the aluminary and demon Sasha Fierce. He also
apparently knows how to play the fiddle, but isn't very good at it, and his
band once lost a battle of the bands to a little boy from Georgia named Johnny
and a bunch of chicken. Don't mention this to the big guy though, unless you
want a face full of fire.
Satan is mentioned or alluded to in a large number of songs, such as "Sympathy
for the Devil" by The Rolling Stones, "Lucifer Sam" by Pink Floyd, "Highway to
    Hell" by AC/DC, "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, and if you play "Stairway to
    Heaven" by Led Zeppelin backwards while they're singing "If there's a
    bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...", it really sounds like
    "Here's to my sweet Satan" and "I sing because I live with Satan"
    (seriously dude, try it)."""
